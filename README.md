MNIST From Scratch in C
Original Source / Inspiration (Credit First)
This project was inspired by the work of:
Ian Dvorin (Magicalbat) - https://github.com/Magicalbat
I used his approach and style as a learning foundation for implementing machine learning systems in C.

Why I Built This
This is my first serious machine learning project implemented from scratch in C.
My goal was to understand the full pipeline behind ML libraries (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) by implementing the core ideas manually, including:

how data is represented in memory
how matrix operations work
